Forked from Justin Abrahmsâ€™ [[https://git.sr.ht/~abrahms/ox-gemini][original ox-gemini]].

* =ox-gemini=
This adds support for exporting org files in gemini format. Many
things in here were taken from the ascii exporter, from which this one
derives.

- Read more about org-mode here: https://orgmode.org/

* What this fork adds
Not much, really. For now, this is just a way for me to apply a fix in
gemini links as described in commit [[https://labs.phundrak.com/phundrak/ox-gemini/commit/94dd2f4a8e5ca50bbfb857395d98da88bf581b6c][94dd2f4]].
This forks fixes two issues the original =ox-gemini= has:
- link descriptions include a newline when the orgmode code also does,
  which breaks things (see commit [[https://labs.phundrak.com/phundrak/ox-gemini/commit/94dd2f4a8e5ca50bbfb857395d98da88bf581b6c][94dd2f4]])
- inline code carries a trailing whitespace (see commit [[https://labs.phundrak.com/phundrak/ox-gemini/commit/1eadafd8e0f9848bb0119076cab15f0b5b23ed0c][1eadafd8e0]])

TODOs formerly in =ox-gemini.el= have also been moved to issues.
