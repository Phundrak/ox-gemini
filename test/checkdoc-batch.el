;;; Commentary:

;; `M-x checkdoc-batch' runs checkdoc.el over the current buffer.  It's not
;; interactive and doesn't change anything but instead presents a report of
;; problems found using a compilation-mode buffer.  `M-x next-error' can
;; step through the problems in the usual compilation-mode style.
;;
;; An accompanying script "emacs-checkdoc-batch" can run checkdoc-batch on
;; .el files from the command line.  It can be run under M-x compile if
;; desired.
;;
;; See the `checkdoc-batch' docstring below for more.

;;; Emacsen:

;; Designed for Emacs 21 and up.  Works in XEmacs 21 except
;; M-x checkdoc-batch-files needs a `file-expand-wildcards' copied from
;; Emacs.

;;; Install:

;; Put checkdoc-batch.el in one of your `load-path' directories and to make
;; `M-x checkdoc-batch' etc available add to your .emacs
;;
;;     (autoload 'checkdoc-batch       "checkdoc-batch" nil t)
;;     (autoload 'checkdoc-batch-files "checkdoc-batch" nil t)
;;
;; There's autoload cookies for this if you install via
;; `M-x package-install' or know `update-file-autoloads'.

;;; History:

;; Version 1 - the first version
;; Version 2 - new checkdoc-batch-files, fix for linenum at end of file
;; Version 3 - another linenum fix
;; Version 4 - support checkdoc-spellcheck-documentation-flag
;; Version 5 - revert-buffer and auto-revert-mode support
;;           - don't show ispell start/stop messages
;; Version 6 - don't use remove-if
;; Version 7 - macros not needed when running byte compiled
;; Version 8 - explicit let of global

;;; Code:

;; for `ad-find-advice' macro when running uncompiled
;; (don't unload 'advice before our -unload-function)

  "Run `checkdoc' on the current buffer, showing results in batch form.
The advantage of `checkdoc-batch' is that it's not interactive,
you just get a list of the problems to step through with
`next-error'.  Some things you might not want to fix, or not yet,
etc.  The full list of problems helps avoid confusion with the
way interactively \"n\" means next docstring, not next
problem (where refusing one change means you don't see other
things in that docstring).

The disadvantage of `checkdoc-batch' is that it's not
interactive, so you don't get the auto-fixes `checkdoc' can
apply.  Normally they're not too complicated though and can be
done manually, or do an interactive `checkdoc' when ready.

The summary output is a bit rough and the way it hooks into
checkdoc.el is very nasty and probably rather fragile.

`auto-revert-mode' can be used there too, though its re-running
